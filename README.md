# Cyber-incident-timeline
Cyber attack timeline simulation project 
# Cyber Incident Timeline Generator 🛡

## Why I selected/made this?
To understand real-world incident response
instead of only running tools.

## What is this project?
This project shows how a cybersecurity analyst
reconstructs an attack using security events.

## Real-World Use Case
This project simulates how SOC analysts and DFIR teams reconstruct
attack timelines during incidents like phishing, malware, or ransomware.
Such timelines are critical for root cause analysis and reporting.

## 🚀 Future Scope
This repository will be continuously expanded to improve practical cybersecurity understanding.  
Planned future enhancements include:

- Adding more real-world cyber incident timelines across different attack types
- Including MITRE ATT&CK mapping for each incident
- Performing deeper root cause analysis
- Adding detection and prevention strategies used by SOC teams
- Introducing visual timelines and diagrams
- Covering incidents across industries such as finance, healthcare, and cloud services
- Improving documentation based on security best practicese critical for root cause analysis and reporting.


## Key Features
- Parses security log events
- Sorts events chronologically
- Generates incident timeline
- Assigns basic risk level
- Helps visualize attack progression

## What does it do?
